first you need to copy the code and add token from remoteme.org 

by creating ifttt voice asistent and other button on there 
we can make control 

setup for esp8266 link 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json, http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

setup all the ports gpio to d1=5,d2=4,d3=0 there and see the upload data 

now connect the wifi and see the connection serial monitor 

now for normal application use resistor and led 

of it is large home appliance 
go for transistor and relay to connect the circuit 

required components 
1. node mcu 
2. relay 12/9 volts operating to 230v 
3. connecting wire 
4. resistor , leds 
or 
4. transistor regulators 7812 or any other normal transistor
5. home wires
